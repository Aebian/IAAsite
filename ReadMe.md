# IAAsite - a small script to bring the IAA back to life


## What's this?

This script does one simple thing: It will add a marker at the NOOSE HQ in Sustancia Road to access the IAA Procceessing Zone.
Inside the Processing Zone building, there is another elevator to get down to the Server Banks. 

Script is fully functional. The next step will be to add peds into the building so that it doesn't look dead :P 

## Installation 

Put the .cs file and the .ini file in your GTA V scripts folder. Usually something like D:\Games\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V\Scripts\
Start the game.
